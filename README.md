# Deep Data Election
Scientific research on the application of machine learning methods in predicting voter turnout based on demographic data.

# Overview 
I conducted research of using artificial neural networks in predicting voter turnout. Studies have shown that attendance can be predicted with accuracy comparable to traditional surveys, which means that in the future it will be possible to replace costly and inaccurate surveys with an artificial neural network that is constantly increasing its accuracy as the amount of training data increases in subsequent years.

# Data
The network was built on the basis of the turnout data for the Polish Sejm  election received from the National Electoral Commission and the demographic data obtained from the Central Statistical Office. The demographic data used are:
1)	Number of marriages per 1000 people
2)	Commune income per capita
3)	Registered unemployment 
4)	Feminisation coefficient
5)	Age dependency ratio
6)	Population per 1 pharmacy 
7)	Useful floor area per 1 inhabitant
8)	Population per 1 library
9)	Enrolment ratio
10)	Economic entities entered into the REGON register per 10,000 people
11)	Population density
12)	X-coordinate of the commune’s centroid
13)	Y-coordinate of the commune’s centroid

RFR and ANN training on data were from 2005, 2007, and 2011.
